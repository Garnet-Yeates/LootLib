# LootLib

LootLib is a library that makes it much easier to modify `NPCLoot` or `ItemLoot` in tModLoader. If you are developing a mod that will make many changes to vanilla loot, this
library will make your code much simpler, more flexible, compatible, and readable. It adds one static class called `LootExtensions` 
to your development environment. This class adds dozens of extension methods to `ILoot` and `IItemDropRule`, as well as extensions to many sub clases of `IItemDropRule`. Check out
the [wiki](https://github.com/Garnet-Yeates/LootLib/wiki) to see its use cases.
